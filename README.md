# Hi, Iâ€™m Hiwa ðŸ‘‹

I'm a Software and AI Engineer with a background in Cognitive Science and Artificial Intelligence (Tilburg University). I work at the intersection of NLP, multimodal machine learning, and full-stack development â€” building systems that turn complex ideas into working products.

### ðŸ’» What I Work With
- **Languages**: Python, C++, JavaScript, SQL
- **ML & NLP**: scikit-learn, PyTorch, HuggingFace, RobBERT, AV-HuBERT
- **Data**: pandas, Parquet, DBT, Snowflake, Oracle SQL
- **Web**: Flask, SQLAlchemy, Tailwind CSS, Jinja2
- **Cloud & DevOps**: GCP (Cloud Run, Storage, Build), Docker, GitHub Actions

### ðŸš€ Selected Projects
Thesis: Perception Modeling

Modeled human impressions of Dutch company names using linguistic and semantic features. 80 models shared on GitHub with full results and feature importance.


AV-HuBERT Pipeline â€“ Research Workshop

Used a pretrained German AV-HuBERT model for lipreading on the GLips dataset. Extracted lip regions from videos, aligned inputs across modalities, and built a full preprocessing pipeline for silent and audio-only testing.


PetMatters â€“ Software Engineering Course

Led an 8-person team to develop a multi-server Flask app for pet adoption. Integrated T5 models for text generation and deployed a responsive front-end with TailwindCSS.


Battle-C â€“ C++ Game Project

Developed a turn-based ship battle game in modular C++. Included bot AI, real-time status updates, and structured game logic.

AI for Nature and Environment

Predicted wildfire risk in a national park using LightGBM. Processed environmental data and trained models for ecological impact forecasting.

NeoCru â€“ Startup Platform (private)

Built a recruitment platform for Dutch businesses using Flask, GCP, and OpenAI API. Supports job posting, resume handling, and secure recruiter dashboards.

LinkInLead â€“ Personal Tool (private)

Created an AI-based LinkedIn content generator using Flask, OpenAI API, and the LinkedIn API. Automates personalized content creation, scheduling, and publishing via Google Cloud.

### ðŸ§  Interests
Applied AI, perception modeling, LLM-powered tooling, full-stack platforms, and building systems that make machine learning usable.
